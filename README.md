## Symfony with DDD, CQRS & Hexagonal Architecture

## ⚠️ WORK IN PROGRESS ⚠️

**Note**: This project is still in its early stages of development, and everything is subject to change.

Despite this, the [Laravel example](https://github.com/filczek/laravel-ddd-cqrs-hex-agnostic) is already up and running. You're welcome to explore the code in the [/src](https://github.com/filczek/laravel-ddd-cqrs-hex-agnostic/tree/master/src) directory, particularly the [Post module](https://github.com/filczek/laravel-ddd-cqrs-hex-agnostic/tree/master/src/Post). This module will eventually be integrated into this project, and rest assured, everything will continue to function as expected.

Just copy & paste, reimplement the `Interface`, `Infrastructure` layer and configure Symfony to use the stuff in `Shared` folder.
